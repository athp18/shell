# Welcome to Shell!

This is a **simple Terminal** built in C++ for fun :)

Right now, this terminal can execute **basic shell commands** such as:

- `ls`
- `cd`
- `grep`
- etc.

Additionally, it can execute basic **bash scripts**. It is able to remember commands in the current Terminal session and execute multi-line arguments.

To use this,
- `git clone https://github.com/athp18/shell.git`
- `cd shell`
- `make`
- `./shell`

The instructions for the Makefile are built assuming you are using a Mac, however they can be easily configured for an OS of your choice.
