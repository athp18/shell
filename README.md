# Welcome to Shell!

This is a **simple Terminal** built in C++ for fun :)

Right now, this terminal can execute **basic shell commands** such as:

- `ls`
- `cd`
- `grep`
- etc.

Additionally, it can execute basic **bash scripts**. It is able to remember commands in the current Terminal session and execute multi-line arguments.
